# Use case: Network



## Dgov Foundation

This is the case where we’d like to do an efficient distribution of several funds and investors to a distributed network. If it’s impractical to deal with a analog registered company and the funds are allocated for a long term, we need a mechanism for keeping the initiatives live and sustainable. So somebody can initialise a purpose-driven initiative \(e.g. develop open-source software or maintain the Ethereum documentation\) and open funds allocation for the cause.

The initiator in such case may be not the person in charge or most responsible — his role is to describe the need and allow the crowdfunding. As the funds start to concentrate on such DAO account it can attract the executors to step in and do the work.

\(e.g. game communities\)

Finally the existent communities can understand a need for some of the work needed, e.g. game communities. There could be a request for a community management, pr & growth or something like championship organization.

So the initiator can open up a DAO for maintaining the community and start crowdfunding. And if in any case the leaders are left the work is undertaken by newcomers or it’s liquidated.

## Liberal Radicalism applied to the Communities

Liberal Radicalism \(further LR\) is a concept described by Glen Weyl, Vitalik Buterin and Zoë Hitzig in [this paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3243656). It combines ideas of Decentralization, Harberger tax and Quadratic Voting \(QV\) for the more optimal provision of public goods in societies. Check out the [short version here](https://medium.com/coinmonks/breaking-down-buterin-hitzig-and-weyls-liberal-radicalism-paper-ba5192248b2).  


I was wondering about using the concept somewhere in connection to my work. It’s quite new and challenging. While auctions are widespread, Harberger Tax and QV are not used in anything mainstream so far. Even in connection to digital and programmable assets like ENS domains, it’s application can be complicated \(see Vitalik comments\).  


But anyway, let’s imagine such concepts applied to the community like dgov. Dgov is a community of enthusiasts built around ideas of distributed governance, blockchain and radical markets. There’re several key players \(like Aragon, DAO Stack, Colony etc\) who can benefit from synergetic research, policy and community building. Any knowledge, relations or infrastructure created can be considered public goods. It’s hard to evaluate and therefore fund. Such a setup is similar to many communities. Let’s imagine what collaboration can happen and how it can be coordinated.

### Brand Sponsorship

The first thing that comes to the mind is the sponsorship e.g. for the forum or wiki. The value brought to the sponsor cannot be clearly estimated. Each sponsor can self-assess it for example based on the exposure, relevancy and alternative costs in the other channels. So let’s assume that community want to sell a specific spot and the starting price is $1 \(or $100 doesn’t matter much\). It can be purchased by any sponsor and then auto-resold \(based on the Harberbger Tax Mechanics\) in the next period through the auction if somebody offers a higher price. Funds from the purchase will go from the new to the old owner.  


Then at any particular time, the owner would need to pay a tax \(e.g. 10% per month\) sent to the community fund for further community development. In the case of wiki let’s assume that there’s no cost of maintaining it, so even if the tax will be tens of dollars monthly that will represent the created value and will organically grow with the community value. Which is better and fairer than the yearly agreement for example and prices defined by some specialist or manager.

### Contributor title

Then we can think of alternative approaches to the membership. Of course, most of the communities don’t request payment for being a member. But personal contributions are pretty big for example in Twitch \(gaming communities\). They are recognized at the time of donation, usually during the stream or in the title of the video. What can provide small but valuable change is seeing each member as a contributor. Even if most of them have provided $0 in payment, we can give them the minimal amount of ownership and influence for signing up. Then we can build profiles, recognize them more efficiently and create some privileges for top contributors \(e.g. providing early access to some content to top100 or honouring them on some page\).  


Of course, analogue mechanics exist already \(e.g. Kickstarter or Patreon\) but usually are structured in the graduation. E.g. $50 – status A, $100= status B. Imho it’s really easy to price those wrong. When it’s a new community you’d need either to undersell first before you’re confident enough or miss some members if priced too high. Participation can come in the form of identity token, badge etc.

### Funds Allocation

Now the most interesting part – the distribution of the proceeds. There’s usually a bunch of projects competing for the budget. Like newsletter, conference, meetups, research grants etc.  


The budget can be represented in the paid working time of the team available. Everybody in the community can distribute the votes, dependent on the values and priorities. But if we have 1-2 major sponsors how do we balance their interests with the vast but low stake community members \(which also fall into the free-rider problem\)? Here does the Quadratic Voting comes to play.  


In accordance with votes \(tokens\) available every community member can distribute them across the projects she feels valuable. The sum resulted in the budget would be proportional

to the square of the sum of the square roots of votes received. By doing so we move to higher equality and representation of minorities.

### Summary and RFC

It’s just an early vision and a fantasy to be thought more and hopefully tested. I really appreciate and welcome any feedback to this. Here’s a bunch of questions that sit in my head:

* How appropriate is the usage of LR here? Is there a problem? Can it be the solution?
* What are the possible gaming scenarios that will harm the community?
* What is hard to understand / where more clarification may be needed?
* Also anything else you feel important \(similar ideas, articles, people to talk to etc\).
