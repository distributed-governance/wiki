## OrgTech Review **Highlights**

[**Subscribe for a weekly newsletter here**](https://orgtech.substack.com/) and thanks to [Jack Laing](https://twitter.com/JackALaing) for doing it.

## ⚖️ Cryptolaw updates

### **GitHub**

Last week GitHub  Iran-based users received emails that their access to repository is being curbed. They have been restricted due to "Trade Control Laws Restrictions". This is well within GitHub's Account Terms of Services as Section B 3.6. All GitHub users who are part of the US sanctioned countries list are thus banned from having an account. Since GitHub is a subsidiary of Microsoft, which [acquired the company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub#cite_note-techcrunch-4) in 2018 for $7.5 billion and is thus a US based company, it must comply with US export laws. 

Devs responded. And the twitter is still echoing their despair. While some are already looking into alternatives and are convinced [‘’this only accelerates the migration to Web3 where big tech can’t be evil’’](https://twitter.com/muneeb/status/1155839698146922496), Microsoft is working on Decentralized Identity which is making it possible to have decentralized identifiers and decentralized datastores that can't be interdicted. See a [response here](https://twitter.com/csuwildcat/status/1155512512919437313) and more about the [project here](https://www.google.com/search?q=Microsoft+is+working+on+Decentralized+Identity&rlz=1C5CHFA_enSI845SI846&oq=Microsoft+is+working+on+Decentralized+Identity&aqs=chrome..69i57j33l2.510j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8).  

### **International Developments** 

* Long awaited Reg A+ epilog has been achieved with SEC’s approval of two digital token offerings under Reg A+. The [very first approval](https://blog.blockstack.org/blockstack-token-sale-sec-qualified/) was granted to Blockstack, the [second approval](https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/11/props-reg-a-token/) was granted to Props, a spin-off of live-streaming company YouNow.  Besides, you might want to look into [SEC and FINRA’s joint statement](https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/joint-staff-statement-broker-dealer-custody-digital-asset-securities#_ftnref28) addressing questions each has received from market participants regarding proper custody of digital assets.  Another notable thing happening in the US is the inter-state agreement between [23 states of America](https://www.csbs.org/23-states-join-multistate-licensing-agreement-financial-services-companies) which have agreed to standardize the licensing process for money transmitters and other money services businesses on a reciprocal basis. Once put into practice, this agreement will help streamline the MSB licensing process among the participants. 
* [UK Financial Conduct Authority \(FCA\) has proposed a ban on crypto derivatives](https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-proposes-ban-sale-crypto-derivatives-retail-consumers) as these types of financial products are inappropriate for retail investors “who cannot reliably assess the value and risks of derivatives or ETNs that reference certain cryptoassets”. Concurrently FCA works on finalising guidance on Cryptoassets. 
* Japan’s proposed an [international network for cryptocurrency payments](https://www.coindesk.com/japan-has-fatf-green-light-to-create-swift-network-for-crypto-report), similar to the SWIFT network used by banks around the globe. Some say this initiative gained support from G7’s Financial Action Task Force \(FATF\), who would monitor the development. 
* The Cayman Islands presented two new laws. [One](https://www.cima.ky/upimages/commonfiles/ProceedsofCrimeAmendmentLaw,2019_1560966628.pdf) broadens the powers and duties of the country’s regulatory authorities, including the Financial Reporting Authority and the Anti-Money Laundering Steering Group, over financial due diligence and governance. The [second one](http://www.gov.ky/portal/pls/portal/docs/1/12764562.PDF) introduces KYC compliance and related AML obligations. The definition of “virtual asset services” excludes security and utility token issuers. Under the bill, a “virtual asset” means “a digital representation of value that can be digitally traded or transferred, and can be used for payment or investment purposes.’’ 
* Changes in this regard were made also in [Canada](http://www.gazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/p2/2019/2019-07-10/html/sor-dors240-eng.html), where exchanges operating in the country must register as money services businesses with FINTRAC, implement a full AML compliance program and report cryptocurrency transaction of $10,000 CAD or more. 
* While the [Bank of Venezuela](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/president-maduro-announces-bank-venezuela-102549570.html) will soon allow its customers to access the country’s state-sponsored cryptocurrency, and [Maduro ordered distribution of 1 mio crypto wallets preloaded with petro](https://news.yahoo.com/maduro-scheme-away-petro-venezuela-143140039.html) to students and youth, there are two more states interested in issuing their own crypto-currency or using an existing one to boost state affairs and economy. [Cuba](https://www.coindesk.com/sanctions-hit-cuba-eyes-cryptocurrency-as-solution-to-financial-woes) has been looking into it as to combat international sanctions against the country, [John McAfee has already offered to help](https://www.coindesk.com/john-mcafee-offers-to-build-cubas-first-cryptocurrency). Meanwhile, Turkish vice president Fuat Oktay [submitted a plan](https://www.globalgovernmentforum.com/turkey-to-introduce-national-blockchain-currency/?utm_source=1+New+Sign+Ups&utm_campaign=27642bbe7f-RSS_EMAIL_CAMPAIGN&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_2d58b002b8-27642bbe7f-195021285&fbclid=IwAR0_XRpF0D-fQYTpQs_n6d_154wGLA6yov0zI93eRhS8Sxx-DjeKMLftaWc) to Turkish parliament to launch a central bank “blockchain based” digital currency within the next four years. 

### **Libra**

Due to U.S. Congress hostile reaction and questioning of Libra, today many are of an opinion that Libra Association as proposed is not happening. 

A while ago members of the U.S. House of Representatives [demanded](https://www.coindesk.com/4-us-lawmakers-join-call-to-freeze-facebooks-libra-project) a freeze on project’s development until government officials can hold hearings and collect information necessary to protect consumer privacy. Soon after Facebook officials met with the Federal Reserve. President Donald Trump stated that the project should be required to obtain a [“new Banking Charter and become subject to all Banking Regulations.”](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1149472282584072192) No one really knows why, although he did subsequently wrote he’s [not a fan](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1149472282584072192) of crypto. 

Calibra has registered as a money services business with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. 

Calibra CEO David Marcus published a [short post on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/notes/david-marcus/libra-2-weeks-in/10158616513819148/) addressing popular questions and describing the flyby of first two weeks. Similar points were made in a [letter](https://www.coindesk.com/facebook-to-senators-libra-cryptocurrency-will-respect-consumer-privacy) to both the House and Senate. 

Officials serious concerns were presented on a hearing, where David Marcus, [testified](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/16/facebooks-david-marcus-testifies-before-the-senate-on-libra.html) before Congress and tried to answer questions about the social media giant’s plans for a cryptocurrency. You can see some highlights [here](https://consent.yahoo.com/collectConsent?brandType=nonEu&.done=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2019%2F07%2F16%2Flibra-in-messenger-whatsapp%2F%3Fguccounter%3D1%26guce_referrer_us%3DaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8%26guce_referrer_cs%3Dqcmmeahq0C0gUtTmzhEHzQ&sessionId=3_cc-session_73a3a79c-51db-47f7-9a37-992e6d2484fd&lang=&inline=false). 

One of possible outcomes is a [bill](https://www.law360.com/articles/1178401/draft-house-bill-would-keep-big-tech-out-of-cryptocurrency) that prohibits technology companies from functioning as financial institutions or issuing digital currencies. Looking at the fines which reach up to $1 million per day for violation, if the proposal passes, this might as well be the new capitalistic version of the GDPR.
